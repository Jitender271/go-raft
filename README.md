# Overview
Go-Raft is an implementation of the Raft consensus and Leader ELection algorithm in Go. Raft is a consensus algorithm designed for managing a replicated log to ensure strong consistency in distributed systems. This project aims to provide a reliable, efficient, and easy-to-understand implementation of Raft, suitable for use in various distributed systems.
